# Lab 1.02 Part 1 - Using the Interpreter

* Using the interpreter, the driver should type in the expressions below
* The navigator can copy and paste the output into the output column. In order to edit this file, click the `Edit` button at the top right corner of the doc. Once you're done editing tap the `Preview` button at the top right corner.
* If the result is unexpected, note that in the third column.
* The driver & navigator can switch roles for each Section

Afterwards, the navigator should share their screen and the driver copies the result
