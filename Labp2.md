# Lab 1.02 Part 2 - Using Expressions

Using the interpreter, the driver should type in the expressions below. The navigator can copy and paste the output into the output column. You can edit this file by hitting the edit button.

AFterwards the navigator should share his screen and the driver copies the result.

### Roles

The driver was

The navigator was

### Before going to the IDE

1. For each item, the navigator predicts the data type of the result and enter into the "String/Integer/Float" column.
2. Next, the navigator predicts the value of the result for each item and enter into it into the "Prediction of Result" column.

||     **Expression**     | **String/Integer/Float** | **Prediction of Result** | **Interpreter Result** |
|-| :------------------: | :-----------------------: | :--------------------: | :-----------------: |
|a| `10 * 2`            | integer  |    20   |         20         |
|b| `.5 * 2`           | float | 1  |                   |
|c| `10/2`             |  |   |                   |
|d| `10%2`             |  |   |                   |
|e| `2 ** 3`           |  |   |                   |
|f| `(2+5)*3`          |  |   |                   |
|g| `2 + 5 * 3`        |  |   |                   |
|h| `'ab' + '12' + '3'`|  |   |                   |
|i| `x`                |  |   |                   |
|j| `"ab" + "cd"`      |  |   |                   |
|k| `'abc' * 2`        |  |   |                   |
|l| `'1'*2 + '2' * 3`  |  |   |                   |
|m| `1 * 2 + '3' * 2`  |  |   |                   |
|n| `'A' ** 2`         |  |   |                   |
|o| `'bc' % 2`         |  |   |                   |
|p| `'bc' / 2`         |  |   |                   |

## Now go to the IDE

Use the interpreter to evaluate the expressions, the navigator write down results in the "Interpreter Result" column after the driver enters them.
