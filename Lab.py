""""PART 3
The four fours challenge
Using four 4's and any operations, try to write equations that have the numbers from 0 to 4 as the answer. You should use Python's arithmetic operations:

+ addition
- subtraction or negation
* multiplication
/ division
( ) parentheses for grouping
** power
You may also use 44 or 4.4, which count as two fours, or .4, which counts as one four. For example, one solution for zero is:
"""
def part3():  
  print("Zero is", 44-44)
  # Your code here
  # When you are ready to run, go to the main.py file

"""PART 4 - BONUS

This is on a new line!
