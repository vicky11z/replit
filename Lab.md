# Lab 1.03 - Printing & Variables
## Part 1 - Printing Practice
Driver:
Navigator:

Practice typing out some statements in the Console.

|**Expression**|**Expected Output**|**Did it do something unexpected?**|
| -- | --  | --  |
| `print("1")`| | |
| `print(1)`| | |
| `print(1 + 2)`| | |
| `print("1" + "2")`| | |
| `print("1")`| | |
| `print("this" + " " + "is" + " " + "a" + " " + "sentence" + ".")`| | |
	

 
## Part 2 - Variables Practice
** Switch driver and navigator! **
Driver:
Navigator:

### 1. Type and run the following in the console
`animal = "dogs"`
`print(animal + " are really cool.")`
Respond to the following
1.	What happens?
2.	How would you make the program print out “cats are really cool” instead? (Paste the code here)


### 2. Type and run the following in the console
`print(dogs + " are cool.")`

Respond to the following questions
1.	What output does this produce?
2.	Why does this happen?

### 3. Rewrite the following Snap! Program in Python in the console

## Part 3 - Four Fours
** Switch driver and navigator! **
** Write code for this part in the lab.py file **

Driver:
Navigator:

### The four fours challenge
Using four 4’s and any operations, try to write equations that have the numbers from 0 to 4 as the answer. You should use Python’s arithmetic operations:
-	`+` addition
-	`-` subtraction or negation
-	`*` multiplication
-	`/` division
-	`( )` parentheses for grouping
-	`**` power

You may also use 44 or 4.4, which count as two fours, or .4, which counts as one four. For example, one solution for zero is:
```print("Zero is", 44-44)```
Can you find a different solution?

Here are what the results, but not the source code, will look like. (Note: answers may have trailing zeros if floating point arithmetic is used which is fine, i.e. 1 may be displayed as 1.0)
```bash
Zero is 0
One is 1
Two is 2
Three is 3
Four is 4
```

## Part 4 - Bonus
Print the output below, but only using one line of code. Feel free to use online resources.
```bash
Wow!
This is on a new line!
Bonus 2
Can you find four fours for 5 to 10?
```

**Vocabulary**
If you have extra time, add this vocab into your notebook.
Variable: A name that refers to a value. ex: `number = 100`
print(): a function that prints a message onto the screen. ex: `print("hello")`
