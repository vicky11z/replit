# Lab 1.04 - Magic Genie

## Project Objective
* Use Python to interact with variables and user input

## Part 1 Creating the Genie
**Write your code in the lab.py file**
a. Have the genie introduce itself.
b. Have the program ask for three separate wishes.
c. Print all the wishes together.

Your program output should look something like this:

*Hint: if you don't remember how to `print`, look in your 1.03 entry in your Notebook.*

## Part 2 Confusing the Genie
**Write your code in the lab.py file**
**Swap driver and navigator**
a. Now it's time to make your genie confused. Edit your code to have him print your first wish as your last wish, and your second wish as your first wish, and your third wish as your second wish.

Your program output should look something like this:

### Hints
* Remember to add spaces you can combine " " to the end of your string using the + operator. So `print("hello" + " " + "student")` would print `hello student`


* This is what the SNAP! blocks would look like for this lab:

## If you finish early...
Define the following words in your notebook.
* **Comment**: Starts with the `#` symbol. Anything written in Python is not run.
* **Input statement**: the `input()` statement lets you input data and save it to a variable.
* **Casting**: converting between data types. e.g. `string(9)`
