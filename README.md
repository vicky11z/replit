# Lesson 1.02: Interactive Mode



## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **interpreter, string, integer, float, value, errors, console, expression**
* Use the Python interpreter to evaluate simple math expressions
* Distinguish between an integer, float, and string
* Navigate the files in our lesson.


## Materials
 We have the following files.

 | **Duration**   | **Description**    |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| [Do Now](#DoNow.md) |  Our usual warm up.         |
| [Lab  Part One - Using the Interpreter](#Labp1.md) | The lab that will the bulk of the class       |
| [Lab  Part Two - Using Expressions](#Labp2.md) | The next part of the Lab       |
|  Read Me | This document |
| [Class Norms](#ClassNorms.md) | Our class norms          |

They can be acessed by clicking on the [files menu.](#FilesNav.png)

Files that end in **md** are "markdown files" which is a shorthand way of making web pages.

Files that end in **py** are "python files". If you click the run button main.py will execute. You don't need to do this for the lab.

## Python Datatypes

In [programming](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp), data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

 | **Category**   | **Members**    |
| ---------- | -------------- |
|Text Type|	str|
|Numeric Types|	int, float, complex|
|Sequence Types|	list, tuple, range|
|Mapping Type|	dict|
|Set Types|	set, frozenset|
|Boolean Type|	bool|
|Binary Types|	bytes, bytearray, memoryview||

For the bulk of the semester we are going to be concerned with **Text** and **Numberic** types. The remaining are, for the most part, structures that we can use our more primitive types.

Just because the concept of text and numbers are simple does not mean they aren't powerful. The world is full off words. 

Floats and Integers (or whole numbers) have different uses. Floats can represent much larger numbers or ones with decimal places. Integers can be faster when doing operations and won't have rounding errors.

## Python Expressions
The motivation for having different datatypes is that you do different operation with each. For instance you can divide two numbers, but dividing a word by another does not make much sense.

It is up to the language designer to decide how to mix different datatypes when using expressions. It makes sense that any operation involving a float and an int would return a float since that number might have a decimal point. Strings are different.

For instance:

```"ho " * 3``` produces laughter while ```"a" + 1``` does not create steak sauce and is instead an error.

## Lesson

#### Guided Activity

* Look at your console on their computer
* The part on right half of the screen is called a **console**:
* The **console** is a place where you can interact with a program.
* The **interpreter** runs Python code.
* To run the Python interpreter, type code into the console and hit "Enter" or click "Run", the code executes immediately.
* If you can do this let us know in chat.
