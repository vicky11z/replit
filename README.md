### Taking input in Python
[from](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/taking-input-in-python/)
Developers often have a need to interact with users, either to get data or to provide some sort of result. Most programs today use a dialog box as a way of asking the user to provide some type of input. While Python provides us with two inbuilt functions to read the input from the keyboard.

- **input ( prompt )**
- **raw_input ( prompt )**

**input ( )** : This function first takes the input from the user and then evaluates the expression, which means Python automatically identifies whether user entered a string or a number or list. If the input provided is not correct then either syntax error or exception is raised by python. For example â€“


```python
print('Enter your name:')
x = input()
print('Hello, ' + x)
```
