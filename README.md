# Lesson 1.01: Experimental Mode

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Begin to understand how repl.it works

## Materials
 We have the following files.

 | **Duration**   | **Description**    |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| [Today's Exercise](#main.py) | The exercise that will show us what you know       |
|  Read Me | This document |
| [Class Norms](#ClassNorms.md) | Our class norms          |

They can be acessed by clicking on the [files menu.](#FilesNav.png)

Files that end in **md** are "markdown files" which is a shorthand way of making web pages.

Files that end in **py** are "python files". If you click the run button main.py will execute.

## Lesson

#### Guided Activity

* Look at your console on your computer
* The part on right half of the screen is called a **console**:
* The **console** is a place where you can interact with a program.
* The **interpreter** runs Python code.
* To run the Python interpreter, type code into the console and hit "Enter" or click "Run", the code executes immediately.
* Go to the main.py file and try running it in the console. What happens? 
* Try editing the code in main.py so it can print your name. How did you do that? 
* If you can do this, or if you need help, let us know in either the repl.it chat or zoom!
